An important note to all my students
=======================================
The students will see a vido on -how to connect to Z/OS using Hercules emulator. 

I prepared this video for those people who has a copy of Z/OS. Z/OS is a licensed software from IBM. They don't sell Z/OS directly. They have removed the download link from their website.

I have shared a previous download link for Z/OS. It seems, now IBM has removed the Z/OS download link as well. IBM only shares the Z/OS with their business partners or with their clients who buy Z/OS and provide a good money in return to IBM.

To get the price of Z/OS, you have to call the IBM executive or IBM support and ask for a quote. I had a conversation with IBM support as well and they don't disclose the price of Z/OS normally. Based on your requirement and the business deal IBM might share the Z/OS  operating system.


The only purpose of creating a video on how to connect to mainframe using Hercules with Z/Os is because of the below reasons-

1) Hercules is a free emulator but it cannot run on its own. You need to have an operating system with it. For example - MVS or Z/Os etc.
   It is difficult for many people to find out how to configure Hercules with any operating system and that is the reason i prepared this video to
   share that knowledge with you.
   
   It is very important to note that I am not here to sell Z/OS neither i know how IBM sells Z/OS. As per Udemy policy, we should not direct students    to buy some softwares outside.
   IBM Z/OS has copyright of IBM and they never share the download link for Z/OS. Some people do not follow ethical teaching and provide links to        download Z/OS through torrent or some other external links. I never endorse those illegal things.

2) One of my students asked me on how to configure ZOs on Hercules and I prepared a video to answer his questions on how to configure Z/OS.


Conclusion : 
The message which i want to give here is very simple. I am here to give honest teaching and if you compare the subjects and topics which i have given here has lots of depth. You can compare this against any other udemy courses on Mainframes and decide by yourself.

I am not here to give any illegal links like torrent links or some external links to get access to a product which is owned by someone and has their
exclusive copyright with them.

The video on how to connect to mainframe using Hercules is only for educational purpose for those who has Z/OS installed in their company or they purchased Z/OS somehow. If you want to know the cost and process to get IBM Z/OS, please contact IBM support.
